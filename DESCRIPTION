Description: Create a scatter plot of image data. Images are plotted in random order, and
    are only plotted if they do not overlap with an already-plotted image. A subset of the
    MNIST handritten digit data (available from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is 
    included for producing an example plot.
